# PizzaFactory
PizzaFactory is a simple pizza ordering service designed to manage pizza orders, inventory, and validate business rules. The system allows customers to order pizzas with different customization options, such as selecting a crust type, adding extra toppings, and placing side orders. The backend service ensures that only valid orders are placed and handles pizza and ingredient availability efficiently.

This project is designed using Java, following object-oriented principles and applying key design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.
